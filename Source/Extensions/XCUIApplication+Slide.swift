  ///     - percent: the position to slide to with 0 being empty and 1 being full
  ///     - timeout: the specified amount of time to wait for the element to exist
  ///     - file: the file in which failure occurred. Defaults to the file name of the test case in which this function was called.
  ///     - line: the line number on which failure occurred. Defaults to the line number on which this function was called.

  /// This functionality is a **workaround** to mimic the slide functionality of
  /// a slider (.adjust(toNormalizedSliderPosition: percent)) by
  /// manually pressing and dragging the slider to a set percentage
  ///
  /// It is **not 100%** accurate due to the value of the slider not exactly matching the percent of the coordinate set
  /// This means that often the percent dragged to is slightly higher than the one set due to rounding errors
  /// The tests will needed to be adjusted manually to account for this
  ///
  /// - parameters:
  ///     - element: the struct containing details of the `XCUIElement` to find
  ///     - startPercent: the starting position the slider is set to
  ///     - endPercent: the final position we want our slider to finish at
  ///     - timeout: the specified amount of time to wait for the element to exist
  ///     - file: the file in which failure occurred. Defaults to the file name of the test case in which this function was called.
  ///     - line: the line number on which failure occurred. Defaults to the line number on which this function was called.
