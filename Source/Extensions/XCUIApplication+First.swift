  ///
  /// **Notes**
  ///
  /// It is always preferred to use the identifier as it is more robust than relying on an index or just on the type.
  /// In the ideal case, one would want to ensure that each identifiers are **unique** per screen.

  ///     - timeout: the specified amount of time to wait for the element to exist
  ///     - file: the file in which failure occurred. Defaults to the file name of the test case in which this function was called.
  ///     - line: the line number on which failure occurred. Defaults to the line number on which this function was called.

  /// - returns: First matching element (using `firstMatch` to stop once an element is found)
